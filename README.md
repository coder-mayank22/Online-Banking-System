### Objectives of the Project
- To simulate an online banking system with essential functionalities, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- To provide a user-friendly console-based interface that allows users to securely manage their accounts.
- To implement authentication and basic encryption for sensitive data, such as passwords, using a Caesar cipher.
- To ensure transaction validation and error handling for secure and robust financial operations.

### Key Activities in this Project
- **User Account Management**: Enables users to create an account with a unique account number and password. Also stores user information securely, including encrypted passwords.
- **Authentication and Security**: Validates user credentials at login with an encrypted password, and provides basic encryption (Caesar cipher) for passwords.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal Operations**: Allows users to deposit funds into their account, recording each transaction in the transaction history. Ensures sufficient funds before withdrawal and updates the balance accordingly.
- **Money Transfer Between Accounts**: Enables users to securely transfer funds to another user’s account. Validates the user’s balance before proceeding and logs the transaction in both accounts.
- **Transaction History and Balance Checking**: Provides users with the option to view a detailed transaction history. Allows users to check their current balance at any time.
- **Error Handling**: Manages exceptions for invalid account numbers, insufficient funds, and failed authentications.

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used for building the banking application, handling input/output, and implementing business logic.
- **Java Collections (ArrayList)**: Used for storing user data and maintaining transaction history.
- **Basic Encryption (Caesar Cipher)**: Secures user passwords with character shifting.
- **Exception Handling**: Ensures application stability by handling errors like insufficient funds and invalid logins.
